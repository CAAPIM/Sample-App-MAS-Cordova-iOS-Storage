# Sample-App-MAS-Cordova-iOS-Storage

## Get Started
1. Open a terminal window to the top level folder of this Sample App (ie: ~/Sample-App-MAS-Cordova-iOS-Storage/MASStorage/platforms/ios)
2. In the terminal type: `pod update`   
   If this fails try: `pod install`
3. Open the .xcworkspace (ie: MASStorage.xcworkspace).
4. In the CA OAuth Manager, create an app, and export the msso_config file (https://you_server_name:8443/oauth/manager). For help with this file, see [*MAS Cordova Developer Guide*](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/content/broadcom/techdocs/us/en/ca-enterprise-software/layer7-api-management/mobile-sdk-for-ca-mobile-api-gateway/2-0/Cordova/Cordova_2-1.html).
5. Copy the contents of the exported msso_config into the msso_config file in the Xcode workspace.
6. Build and Deploy the app to a device or Simulator.

In case, if you need to work with native libraries directly i.e. not using the Cocoapods denpendecy injection, then follow the steps mentioned in [*MAS Cordova Developer Guide*](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/content/broadcom/techdocs/us/en/ca-enterprise-software/layer7-api-management/mobile-sdk-for-ca-mobile-api-gateway/2-0/Cordova/Cordova_2-1.html) under the section Developer Mode.
